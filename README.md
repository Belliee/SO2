### General info
The aim of the project is to create an application that uses multithreading and critical sections: mutexes or semaphores.
This project is simple implementation of Arcanoid, computer game in which, using a small mobile platform, you bounce a ball inside a rectangle that is open on one side. The game was created and published by the Taito company in 1986 for slot machines.
